# gateway
This is not a *"gateway"*. Well, it's disguised as a *gateway*. It's actually an **IP address stealer!**

This repository handles the "backend" components of the IP address stealer, such as saving the stolen IP address to the cloud and redirecting the user to somewhere non-suspicious.

## URL Formatting
`https://chibbit-99.github.io/gateway`?id=6&redirect=https://example.com
* **id**: The numerical identifier for the stolen ip, used for organisation.
* **redirect**: The URL that the user is redirected to after the  IP is stolen.
